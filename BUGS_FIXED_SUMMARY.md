# Bugs Fixed During Code Review

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. V2 Components Not Being Used ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: The application was still importing old components instead of the new V2 versions
- `src/app/mirror/page.tsx` was importing `MirrorApp` instead of `MirrorAppV2`
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` was importing `ProfileDashboard` instead of `ProfileDashboardV2`

**Impact**: All the fixes for Problems 1, 2, and 3 wouldn't actually be used by the application!

**Fix**: Updated imports to use the V2 components

### 2. Wrong Component Import in MirrorAppV2 ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: `MirrorAppV2` was importing `PointsDisplay` instead of `PointsDisplayV2`

**Impact**: Points wouldn't display correctly using the unified storage

**Fix**: Updated to import and use `PointsDisplayV2`

### 3. Missing Import in UnifiedStorage ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: `SessionHistoryItem` type was used but not imported in `unified-storage.ts`

**Impact**: TypeScript compilation error

**Fix**: Added `SessionHistoryItem` to the imports from `@/lib/mirror/types`

### 4. Missing Required Field in Session Creation ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: `createSession` call in `EvaTransmissionV2` was missing the required `sessionDate` field

**Impact**: Session creation would fail when completing a transmission

**Fix**: Added `sessionDate: new Date()` to the session data

## Summary of All Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/app/mirror/page.tsx` - Now uses MirrorAppV2
2. `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Now uses ProfileDashboardV2
3. `src/components/mirror/mirror-app-v2.tsx` - Now uses PointsDisplayV2
4. `src/components/mirror/eva-transmission-v2.tsx` - Added sessionDate field
5. `src/lib/storage/unified-storage.ts` - Added SessionHistoryItem import

### Verification Steps Completed:
- ✅ All V2 components exist
- ✅ All required imports are present
- ✅ No TypeScript/linting errors
- ✅ All database functions created by migrations
- ✅ Session creation has all required fields
- ✅ Unified storage properly handles authentication

## What This Means

With these bugs fixed, the application will now:
1. **Actually use the unified storage system** (Problem 1 fix)
2. **Persist onboarding state to database** (Problem 2 fix)
3. **Update points atomically without race conditions** (Problem 3 fix)

The three major problems are now fully integrated and working together!
