2/8 🛠️ What We're Fixing Right Now
We're working around the clock to solve the issues you've been experiencing. Here's what we're addressing during this maintenance:

No more endless loading when you click Mirror or Profile! We're rebuilding the authentication flow so everything loads properly or takes you to login seamlessly.

Your points have been scattered between your device and our servers. We're consolidating everything into one reliable system so you never lose progress again.
