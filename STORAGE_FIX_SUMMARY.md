# Unified Online-Only Storage Fix Summary

## Completed Fixes ✅

### 1. Fixed Profile Page Import
**File**: `src/app/profile/page.tsx`
- Changed from: `import ProfileDashboard from "@/components/profile/profile-dashboard";`
- Changed to: `import ProfileDashboard from "@/components/profile/profile-dashboard-v2";`

**Impact**: This was the PRIMARY cause of points disappearing. The V1 dashboard was using the old hybrid storage system.

### 2. Fixed Mirror App V2 Import
**File**: `src/components/mirror/mirror-app-v2.tsx`
- Changed from: `import EvaTransmission from "./eva-transmission";`
- Changed to: `import EvaTransmission from "./eva-transmission-v2";`

**Impact**: Ensures Mirror sessions use the unified storage system.

### 3. Removed LocalStorage Profile Write
**File**: `src/lib/storage/unified-storage.ts`
- Removed: `writeJson(StorageKeys.userProfile, profile);` (line 535)
- Reason: This was writing profile data to localStorage for backward compatibility

## Current Storage Architecture

### ✅ Online-Only Components (Correct)
- `ProfileDashboardV2` - Uses `useUnifiedProfile` hook
- `MirrorAppV2` - Uses unified storage
- `EvaTransmissionV2` - Saves sessions to Supabase
- `PointsDisplayV2` - Reads from unified profile
- `OnboardingWizardV2` - Uses unified storage

### ✅ UnifiedStorageManager
- Supabase is the single source of truth
- localStorage used ONLY for:
  - Performance cache (read-only)
  - Twitter auth token
  - UI preferences (theme, etc.)
- All point calculations happen server-side
- Sessions saved directly to Supabase

## How It Works Now

1. **User Signs In**
   - Twitter auth stored in localStorage
   - Profile loaded from Supabase
   - Cache updated for performance

2. **Points Display**
   - ProfileDashboardV2 uses `useUnifiedProfile`
   - Points loaded from Supabase
   - Real-time updates via subscription

3. **Session Completion**
   - EvaTransmissionV2 saves to Supabase
   - Points calculated server-side
   - Profile updated atomically

4. **Page Refresh**
   - Profile loaded from Supabase (not localStorage)
   - Points persist correctly
   - OG status maintained

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in with Twitter
- [ ] Check profile page shows points
- [ ] Refresh page - points should persist
- [ ] Complete a Mirror session
- [ ] Check points increased
- [ ] Refresh - new points should persist
- [ ] Sign out and sign back in
- [ ] All points should be intact

## Questions to Consider

1. **Cache Strategy**: The UnifiedStorage still uses localStorage as a performance cache. Should we keep this or go 100% online-only?

2. **Migration**: Should we add a one-time migration to clear old localStorage data for existing users?

3. **Error Handling**: What should happen if Supabase is temporarily unavailable?

4. **OG Points**: The system checks OG status on every profile load. Should we add the one-time application tracking as planned?

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: These changes should immediately fix the points disappearing issue
2. **Monitor**: Watch for any error logs or user reports
3. **OG Recovery Dialog**: Implement as planned for users who need to recover points
4. **Clean Reset**: Add session reset functionality as designed
